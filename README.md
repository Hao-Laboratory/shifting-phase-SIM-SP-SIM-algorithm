# shiftPhaseSIM
Codes based on Matlab for "shifting-phase SIM (SP-SIM)"  algorithm

The algorithm was proposed in the article "Fast reconstruction algorithm for structured
illumination microscopy" (https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.387888)

The folder 'functions' includes the necessary subroutine;

The folder 'results' includes the raw simulated and experimental images.

'main_SPSIM.m' is the main algorithm to get a reconstruction result.

'supplementary material.docx' provides the details about equations and simulation in the manuscript
